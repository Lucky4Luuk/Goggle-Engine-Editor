# Goggle-Engine-Editor
This is the repository for the actual GUI Editor code.

# How to use
Installer:
Sorry, I haven't taken the time to make an installer that does everything for you.
As the Engine is far from being completed, I don't think an installer is coming soon.
The manual way shouldn't be too difficult, though.

The manual way:
1. Download and extract a ZIP of this repository.
2. Download a ZIP of the Engine Repository.
3. Inside the Editor folder, create a folder called "Engine".
4. Extract the ZIP of the Engine into the Engine folder, making sure that the main.lua is in the Engine folder, and not in Engine/Goggle-Engine-Final.
5. Run the Editor with Love2D 0.11!
