# How to use
Installer:
Sorry, I haven't taken the time to make an installer that does everything for you.
As the Engine is far from being completed, I don't think an installer is coming soon.
The manual way shouldn't be too difficult, though.

The manual way:
1. Download and install Love2D 0.11. Note: this is a nightly build! http://love2d.org/builds
   The installer for the nightly build is quite hard to find, but it's located in Slime's Appveyor.
2. Download and extract a ZIP of this repository.
3. Run the Editor with Love2D 0.11!
